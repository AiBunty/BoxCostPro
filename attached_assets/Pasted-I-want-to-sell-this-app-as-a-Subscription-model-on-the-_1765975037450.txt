Also, a Checkbox System is to be added by which the user can Select Which Items to be considered for sending via WhatsApp or email

Provide a Control panel for Owner of the app to Manage Subricption and Offer Coupon Codes, Send trial email link to customer, Set pricing and Make Nessesary changes. Also Need an Option to add Payment gateway from Razorpay for swift payments for the customer who are willing to take the subscription


Also, create a Chatbot which can be installed on the Website of Customers, which will use the help of this Costing calculator to make the costing

For Fluting Factor, make a Setting Button Where the user will set the Fluting Factor for each flute as per his machine for A,B,C,E,F so no need to input in Paper Layer User has to Just select the Fluting Combination like for 3Ply A,B.C or E  For 5 Ply BB,AB,BC and all Permutation Combination and so on for 7 and 9 Ply combination  while Selecting Ply


Since the Fluting Factor is defined in the Setting, no need to show Fluting Factors in Paper Specifications (Layer by Layer), so Fluting factors are to be considered from the settings only.

When an Item is added to a Quote, show it with details in a table format in Row & Column, Each Cost Separately. There will be a Check box Option Over the table to decide which items selected only will be in WhatsApp and email draft for sending it to the customer

Also, there should be an Option for the customer to download data in Excel, So Create a Report page where it will show All The Costing Boxes made for Particular party and same can be exported for use in excel

Also, there should be an Option to upload the data in Bulk via Excel and Download Option for Sample Upload Data Excel File

Replace Load CSV Download CSV with Excel
Also name the Liner Layer as L1,L2,L3 and Fluting Layer as F1,F2,F3

Also Add Option to Add, Edit , Search Party in Party Profile , Same for Business Profile





When we Press the Edit button Under Paper Specification Fluting Factor is there , Remove it as All Fluting calculations to be taken only from the Fluting Settings Button

No Need to show the formula directly. Insert an 'i logo when the mouse hovers over it, and it will show the formula. The same applies to the Burst Strength (BS) Formula. Same for Formula: Weight

Under Quote Items: Add a Function to Edit and Delete Quote after we add the Item to Quote 

Also, the Table Created will have a check box in every column, So we can select the Cost input we want to show to customers 
it will be great if it can come below Fixed & Manufacturing Costs Taking Full Row so we dont need to scroll it much

Keep Default Conversion Rs.15

Also Email draft has Only Codes in it , And not Rich Text Quote format

You are building a Corrugated Box Costing SaaS.

Implement a feature to automatically set default paper types
for a user during first-time setup.

Core Requirements:

1. Default Paper Types
When a user opens “Paper Price Settings” for the first time,
auto-create the following paper types for that user:

- Kraft/Natural
- Golden Kraft
- Testliner
- Virgin Kraft Liner
- White Kraft Liner
- White Top Testliner
- Duplex Grey Back (LWC)
- Duplex Grey Back (HWC)
- Semi Chemical Fluting
- Recycled Fluting
- Bagass (Agro based)

2. Default Behavior
- Set premiumAmount = 0 for all default paper types
- Allow user to edit, rename, or delete these paper types
- Allow user to add unlimited new paper types

3. One-Time Setup Rule
- Insert default paper types ONLY if the user has no existing paper types
- Do NOT insert defaults again if user already has paper data

4. Data Model
Store paper types per user:
- userId
- paperName
- premiumAmount

5. UI Requirements
- Show default paper types in Paper Price Settings
- Provide “+ Add New Paper Type” option
- Clearly indicate paper types are editable

Output Required:
- First-time setup logic
- Default paper type insertion logic
- Clean, maintainable code
