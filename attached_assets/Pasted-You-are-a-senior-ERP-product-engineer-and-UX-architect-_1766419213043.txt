You are a senior ERP product engineer and UX architect.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- This is a multi-tenant ERP SaaS (PaperBox ERP / AiBunty)
- Reports currently exist but are READ-ONLY
- This is NOT acceptable for enterprise usage
- There is NO production data yet, so refactors are safe

================================================
GLOBAL REPORT DESIGN RULES (MANDATORY)
================================================

1. NO report is read-only.
2. Every report row MUST be actionable.
3. Every report MUST allow:
   - View
   - Edit
   - Update
   - Return to same report with filters preserved
4. Reports act as navigation hubs, not dead ends.
5. All navigation must remain tenant-safe.

================================================
STANDARD REPORT BEHAVIOR (APPLY TO ALL)
================================================

For EVERY report table:
- Make primary identifier clickable
- Add explicit action buttons:
  - View
  - Edit
- On click → navigate to source module
- On save → return back to report automatically

Preserve:
- Filters
- Date range
- Search query
- Pagination state

================================================
QUOTE REPORTS (CRITICAL)
================================================

From ANY quote-related report:
- Clicking quote number opens Quote Edit screen
- Quote opens in EDIT MODE (not read-only)
- After Save:
  - Redirect back to report
  - Show success toast
  - Maintain same filters

================================================
PARTY SUMMARY REPORT (VERY IMPORTANT)
================================================

Fix Party Summary report to behave as follows:

When user clicks on a Party:
1. Navigate to Party Detail View
2. Show FULL list of:
   - All quotes created for that party
   - Quote number
   - Date
   - Amount
   - Status
3. Each quote row must be clickable
4. Clicking a quote:
   - Opens Quote Edit screen
   - Allows edit/update
   - Returns back to Party → Quotes view

This is a DRILL-DOWN REPORT, not a static summary.

================================================
ALL REPORT TYPES TO FIX
================================================

Apply this behavior to ALL reports, including but not limited to:
- Party Summary
- Quote Register
- Date Range Reports
- Item-wise Reports
- Party-wise Quote Reports
- Sales Summary
- Any future report added

================================================
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION RULES
================================================

- Reports should not duplicate business logic
- Reports must use record IDs for navigation
- Editing must happen ONLY in source modules
- Reports only redirect, never edit directly
- Use query params or state to preserve report context

================================================
UX REQUIREMENTS
================================================

- Cursor pointer on clickable rows
- Hover highlight on rows
- Clear “Edit” icon/button
- Breadcrumb navigation:
  Reports → Party Summary → Quotes → Edit Quote

================================================
SECURITY & TENANT SAFETY
================================================

- All report queries must respect tenant_id
- No cross-tenant data exposure
- Editing permissions must respect user role
- Staff users see edit only if allowed by permission

================================================
DELIVERABLES REQUIRED
================================================

1. Refactor ALL report components to be editable
2. Implement drill-down navigation for Party Summary
3. Add edit routing for Quote from reports
4. Preserve report filter context on return
5. Ensure tenant-safe queries
6. Clean, commented, production-ready code

DO NOT:
- Leave any report read-only
- Duplicate edit forms inside reports
- Break navigation context
- Bypass permission checks

Build reports as ENTERPRISE-GRADE, ACTIONABLE modules.
