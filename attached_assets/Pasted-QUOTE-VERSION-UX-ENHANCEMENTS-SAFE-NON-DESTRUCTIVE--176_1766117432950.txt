QUOTE VERSION UX ENHANCEMENTS (SAFE & NON-DESTRUCTIVE)

================================================
1. NEW VERSION TOAST
================================================

When user clicks “Save Quote” AND an existing quote exists
(same Party + Box Name + Box Size):

- Show informational toast:
  “This will create a new version of the existing quote.”

Rules:
- Toast only, no modal.
- Do NOT block save.
- Auto-dismiss after a few seconds.

================================================
2. DUPLICATE BOX WARNING
================================================

Before saving a quote, if an existing quote is found with:
- Same Party
- Same Box Name
- Same Box Size

Show inline warning:
“A quote already exists for this box. Saving will create a new version.”

Rules:
- Informational only.
- Save must still proceed normally.

================================================
3. VERSION COMPARISON
================================================

Add version comparison feature:

- Allow selecting two quote versions.
- Show side-by-side comparison (read-only).
- Highlight changed values.

Compare fields:
- Box details
- Paper summary
- Manufacturing costs
- GST
- Final & negotiated price

Rules:
- Do NOT allow editing.
- Do NOT recalculate values.

================================================
4. VERSION RESTORE
================================================

Restore behavior:

- Restoring a version must NOT reactivate old version.
- Create a NEW version using selected version’s data.
- Mark new version as active.

Show confirmation message:
“Version restored as a new active version.”

================================================
STRICT RULES
================================================

- NEVER overwrite existing versions.
- NEVER directly activate old versions.
- All restore/edit actions must create new versions.
- Do NOT modify costing logic or formulas.

If any requirement is unclear:
STOP and ASK.
