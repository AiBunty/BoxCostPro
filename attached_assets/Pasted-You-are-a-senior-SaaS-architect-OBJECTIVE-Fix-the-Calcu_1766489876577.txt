You are a senior SaaS architect.

OBJECTIVE:
Fix the Calculator architecture by enforcing a SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for
Persona, Business, and Branding data.

================================================
RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
================================================

1. Persona, Business, Branding MUST NOT exist as separate concepts.
2. ALL identity & branding data must come ONLY from Accounts.
3. Calculator must NEVER edit profile data.
4. Profile editing must be centralized and auditable.

================================================
STEP 1: REMOVE WRONG IMPLEMENTATIONS
================================================

- Remove Persona tab completely
- Remove Branding tab completely
- Remove "Business Profile" button from Calculator UI
- Remove any profile read/write logic from calculator code

================================================
STEP 2: CREATE SINGLE ACCOUNT PROFILE PAGE
================================================

Create a single page:
Settings → Account Profile

Fields (AUTO-FILLED & LOCKED from registration):
- Company Name (required)
- Owner Name (required)
- Email (required)
- Phone Number (required)

These fields are READ-ONLY by default.

To edit them:
- Require email verification
- Log audit event

Editable Fields:
- GST Number
- Website
- Social Media Links
- Google Location Link
- Company Logo (PNG/JPG, max 100KB)

================================================
STEP 3: DATABASE
================================================

Create accounts table as single source of truth.

Remove:
- persona tables
- branding tables
- duplicated business profile fields elsewhere

================================================
STEP 4: CALCULATOR BEHAVIOR
================================================

Calculator must:
- Read company name, logo, owner from accounts
- Never show profile edit UI
- Never store profile data

================================================
STEP 5: SECURITY
================================================

- Enforce tenant isolation
- Profile edits logged in audit_logs
- Logo upload validated for size and type
- Supabase Storage paths tenant-scoped

================================================
DELIVERABLES
================================================

1. Database migration SQL
2. Clean Account Profile UI
3. Updated Calculator logic (read-only)
4. Removed dead code & buttons
5. Audit logging for profile edits

This must be enterprise-grade, clean, and future-proof.
