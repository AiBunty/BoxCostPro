You are building a Corrugated Box Costing SaaS.

Create a USER-LEVEL “Paper Price Settings” feature with:
- Default BF pricing
- GSM-based adjustment rules
- Global market adjustment
- Fully customizable paper shades with premiums

Important Rules:
- Base paper price is defined ONLY by BF
- GSM and shade premiums are applied as adjustments
- Users must be able to create their own paper shades
- All pricing data is user-specific (multi-tenant)

Core Requirements:

1. Default BF Pricing
On first setup, pre-fill the following editable BF prices:
14 BF → 32.00
16 BF → 33.00
18 BF → 34.00
20 BF → 35.00
22 BF → 36.50
24 BF → 38.50
28 BF → 44.50
35 BF → 50.00
Allow user to edit, add, or remove BF rows.

2. GSM Adjustment Rules
Allow user to define:
- Low GSM limit and adjustment
- High GSM limit and adjustment

All values must be user-editable.

3. Paper Shade Management

- Allow user to:
  - View existing shades
  - Add new shade using a “+ Add New Shade” button
- Each shade must have:

  apply the premium amount defined by the user
- Support unlimited shades per user

5. Market Adjustment
