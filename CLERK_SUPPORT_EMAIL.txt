Subject: URGENT: Revoke Compromised Secret Key

Hello Clerk Support Team,

My Clerk secret key was accidentally committed to a public GitHub repository and is now compromised.

Application Name: BoxCostPro
Clerk Application ID: (You can find this in your Clerk dashboard)

COMPROMISED SECRET KEY (PLEASE REVOKE IMMEDIATELY):
[INSERT YOUR OLD COMPROMISED KEY HERE - starts with sk_test_]

I have already:
✅ Generated a new secret key from the Clerk dashboard
✅ Updated my application with the new key
✅ Tested that the new key works correctly
✅ Removed .env files from git tracking
✅ Installed pre-commit hooks to prevent future accidents

The new key is working correctly in both development and production environments.

Please revoke/delete the compromised key listed above immediately to prevent any unauthorized access to my application.

Thank you for your urgent assistance with this security matter.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
